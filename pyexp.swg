// This file (in this location) prevents _POSIX_C_SOURCE warnings when
// compiling SWIG-generated C code with compilers newer than gcc-2.95,
// or with Python versions newer than 2.1.

// It is a modified version of the SWIG-supplied pyexp.swg file.  The
// only^H^H^H^Hfirst modification is the first include line, which
// includes Python.h before anything else -- this gets inserted before
// the rest of any SWIG-generated C code, and prevents _POSIX_C_SOURCE
// redefinition warnings.

// This works because SWIG follows a rigid search path for this
// file, and putting the modified one in the SRC directory pre-empts
// the stock as-distributed one.
