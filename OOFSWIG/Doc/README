SWIG Documentation   8/27/97	
----------------------------

(8/27/97) Update
----------------
An online version of the User's manual is now available at

     http://www.cs.utah.edu/~beazley/SWIG/Doc1.1/Contents.html

SWIG Users Manual
-----------------
The directory 'UserManual' contains the entire SWIG Users Manual
in Adobe PDF format. To view it, you will need Adobe Acrobat 
reader which is freely available from Adobe at :

       http://www.adobe.com/prodindex/acrobat/readstep.html

Many machines already have Acrobat installed (try typing 'acroread' if
using Unix). If you are unable to use Acrobat, a postscript version of
the manual is available from the SWIG FTP site.

The User Manual is 318 pages and broken up into individual chapters
covering various aspects of SWIG.  There is probably little need to
print the entire manual--just look at the introductory sections and
the chapter for the scripting language that you're using.

The file 'Contents.pdf' brings up a table of contents and is linked
to all of the other files.

SWIG Reference Manual
---------------------
The directory 'Reference' contains a short SWIG Reference manual that
describes all of SWIG's command line options, directives, and other
options.   Experienced SWIG users may find this to be more useful
than the full Users Manual.  

Note : The reference manual is new and should be consider to be a draft
version.

Other Useful Information
-------------------------

Porting      - A file describing some of the issues related to moving
               to SWIG 1.1 from version 1.0.

c++-dynamic  - A Usenet article by Frank Pilhofer about the issues 
               related to building dynamic C++ extensions to Tcl.
               C++ users may find this to be helpful in fixing 
               SWIG/C++ compilation problems.


Known Bugs
-----------
Acrobat may complain about the PDF files being 'damaged' but repairs
them.   This is usually due to CR/LF translation that is sometimes
performed by uncompression tools.  As far as I know, this error is
harmless and the PDF files can be viewed normally.

Ghostscript does not view the resulting .ps files correctly.  This
seems to be due to a font-problem.
