This directory contains several subdirectories containing input files and scripts
for testing different aspects of SWIG.   Some of these tests consume *alot* of
disk space so be forewarned.  You can run different tests by simply using the
makefile in this top level directory :

make parser

	This tests the SWIG parser and performs regression testing.
	If regression files are available, the test script will report
	differences.  If the files are not available, it will create them
	automatically for use the next time the script is run.   This
	test consumes alot of disk space.

make doc

        Tests the SWIG documentation system.

make build

	This attempts to build various C extensions for different target
	languages.  It will use the file 'Makefile.template' in the top
	level directory.   Use this to make sure the Makefile works before
	installing it

make errors

	This runs the parser through some checks to make sure it's
	error reporting is working.   Normally this isn't done since
	it looks rather scary.

make all
	
	Tests everything.
